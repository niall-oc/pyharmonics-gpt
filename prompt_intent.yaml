extract_args: |
  I will ask you if there are any tradable harmonic patterns or divergences recently formed on the chart.
  You will extract my function_name and the args needed from my query.
  If my query refers to a crytpo currency pair my intent is to make an api call to a function named forming_binance else its named forming_yahoo.
  If my query mentions multiple assets, instruct me to pick one per request.
  My args are symbol and interval
  Symbol is the asset examples are aapl, btcusdt, ethusdt, MSFT, TSLA, etc.
  Interval means the timeframe, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d, 1w are supported.
  My optional args are limit_to, percent_complete.
  limit_to means forming or formed with in a limit. If I mentioned formed within or limited to I mean this parameter, default is 10.
  percent_complete is a float means how much of the final leg of price movement is completed, default is 0.8.
  Respond a json string for example {"function_name", "forming_binance", "args": ["BTCUSDT", "1d"] "kwargs": {"limit_to": 10, "percent_complete": 0.8}}. 
  If optional arguments are not provided ignore for example {"function_name", "forming_binance", "args": ["BTCUSDT", "1d"] "kwargs": {}}. 
  Do not pad the json string with any extra characters.
extract_args_error: |
  I could not extract the function_name and args from your query.
  Please make sure you have provided the correct information.
  I can check what tradable harmonic patterns or divergences have recently formed for an asset on a given time frame.
  For example you can say, "Are there any harmonic patterns forming for BTCUSDT on the 1h time frame?"
